# Debridement (Skin/Subcutaneous/Muscle/Fascia/Bone)

**Trigger Terms:** debridement, excision of necrotic tissue, sharp debridement
**Exclusions:** Only cleansing/irrigation without removal of devitalized tissue
**Root Operation:** Excision (B) for removal of devitalized tissue
**Approach:** Open (0) unless explicitly percutaneous or external
**Depth Mapping (Examples):**
- Skin only → Body part: skin of [region]
- Subcutaneous tissue → Body part: subcutaneous tissue of [region]
- Muscle → Body part: muscle of [region]
- Bone → Body part: [specific bone] of [region]
**Device:** Z (No device) unless a device is left in place
**Qualifiers:** Per official tables; diagnostic qualifier only if pathology is diagnostic intent

**Query If Missing:**
- Exact body part/region (e.g., "left lower leg muscle")
- Depth precisely documented (avoid ambiguous phrasing like "down to the muscle"; prefer "into the muscle")
- Approach if not obvious from context
- Any device left in place
